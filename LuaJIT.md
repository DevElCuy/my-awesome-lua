[Wren](http://wren.io/performance.html):
> LuaJIT is run with the JIT disabled (i.e. in bytecode interpreter mode)[...] LuaJIT with the JIT enabled is much faster than all of the other languages benchmarked, including Wren, because **Mike Pall is a robot from the future**.

> A big thanks to Mike Pall for creating Dynasm, the framework that helped quickly construct the code generator in two days. It is quality work.

[PHP JIT is using DYNASM_x86](https://mobile.twitter.com/dr4goonis/status/806817526097346560)
> #PHP's experimental JIT branch is currently 54% faster than PHP7.1. We are in for another huge performance jump in our next major release :)

> PHP JIT is using DYNASM_x86 (from the luajit proj) under the hood for code compilation.
